# DIY Speed cube timer

I Don't know if you know but I know how to solve the Rubik's cube pretty fast under 40 seconds. To be specific my record is 31.89 seconds. And I use a computer to time my solves and its starting to be pretty unpractical and slow to use a computer.

And all timers in the market are 30€ to 40€ and they are ugly and super plasticky. And that is where the idea surged: Make my own timer!

My timer would be:
- Cheaper: I plan to make my timer affordable it depends if the components are affordable.
- Nicer: unlike the generic timers you find everywhere.
- Easy to use: like the generic timers you find everywhere.
- Open Source I aim to make the project open source.
- A fun project: It probably will be a A fun project.

So ya that is why I want to make my own timer So it would be easier to time my solves. 

Next steps:
- Sketch the timer. Visualizing the design and layout of the timer.
- Plan the hardware that I'm going to use. (By hardware I mean electronics and components)
- Make an update post. To show my progress.

That's all! If you have any feedback, Ideas or if you want to help. Let me know!

BTW I use https://cstimer.net to time my solves. (If you are a speed cuber you probably already use or know csTimer)
